A fun weather app made using basic JavaScript 

# Disclamer
1. Whole using this software, we need location permition but it is not stored infact we don't have access to the required location permision
You can still check code

2. I have used a random api which I found online so don't use that api key

3. If you are wondering, I am not from California
